Short Description
AKFWANT-Vs2019 is a 3-D shear-wave isotropic model for Alaska and western Canada from full-wave ambient noise tomography with resolvable depth for the top 150 km. The Vs model with good resolution (> 70% recovery) is from the depth of 15 km to the depth of 110 km. The tomography was based on an empirical Green’s function data set extracted from cross-correlation between station pairs. The tomography method involves 3-D wave propagation simulation. The travel-time different between the synthetics and the observed empirical Green’s functions are inverted for finite-frequency sensitivity kernels to get velocity perturbations. The velocity model is updated iteratively for a total of five iterations.

Reference Model
The reference velocity model consists of two parts: a global shear-velocity model for the top 400 km (Shapiro and Ritzwoller, 2002) and the IASP91 1-D Earth model from 400 km down to 1000 km (Kennett and Engdahl, 1991).

Model Resolution
As tested and validated by previous applications of full-wave tomographic imaging (e.g., Gao, 2018; Zhang and Shen, 2008), Rayleigh waves are most sensitive to P-wave velocity at shallow depths (< 15 km) and to S-wave velocity at greater depths. Although P-wave velocity model is also provided for all depth, interpretation of P velocities deeper than 15 km and shallower than 5 km is discouraged. The model provided here is from the inversion result of the 5th iteration without smoothing or interpolation. When interpreting the velocity model, it is recommended that the user smooth the model based on the best resolution at the corresponding depth. The checkerboard tests show that shear-wave velocity perturbations can be well resolved with horizontal scales of 44 km, 66 km, 88 km, 110 km, 132 km, and 154 km at the depths of 15 km, 32 km, 51 km, 74 km, 97 km, and 134 km, respectively.
